/*One day three best friends Patti Patti and legi are decided to form a team and take part in a programming contest<br> 
participating are usually offered several problems during the programming contest<br>
long before they have decided that they will implement a problem <br>
if at least two of them are sure about it the solution otherwise they wont write the problem solution<br>
this contest offers n number of problems for each problem we know which friend is sure about the solution<br>
help the friend find the number of problem for which they can write the solution<br>
Input Format :- The first input line contains a single integer n is the number of problem the contestant can solve<br>
                for their the total number of the end line contains the three integers each of the integer is either 0 or 1<br>

/*
Median of 2 Sorted Arrays of Different Sizes<br> 
Hard Accuracy: 50.0% Submissions: 19623 Points: 8<br>
Given two sorted arrays array1 and array2 of size m and n respectively.<br>
Find the median of the two sorted arrays.<br>
<br>
Example 1:<br>
<br>
Input:<br>
m = 3, n = 4<br>
array1[] = {1,5,9}<br>
array2[] = {2,3,6,7}<br>
Output: 5<br>
Explanation: The middle element for<br>
{1,2,3,5,6,7,9} is 5<br>
Example 2:<br>
<br>
Input:<br>
m = 2, n = 4<br>
array1[] = {4,6}<br>
array2[] = {1,2,3,5}<br>
Output: 3.5<br>
